# README #

This is a base project for creating the classic Atari Game Pong.
This game uses a simple framework that is intended for use by first year students at the University of Gloucestershire.
This simple framework is by no means complete and is used to allow students to begin creating game in C++ without having to first 
negotiate the rigmorale of setting up an OpenGL rendering context and handling image loading.

To get this set up you will need Visual Studio 2013 or 2015, simply pull the repository. 
The VS Project file can be found in the proj folder, simply open and compile. 
Then run the executable.
